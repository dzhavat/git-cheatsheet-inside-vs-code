# Git Cheatsheet ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.git-cheatsheet))

VS Code extension that lets you open a Git cheatsheet directly in the editor.

## Features

To open the cheatsheet press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Win, Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) and search for the `Open Git Cheatsheet` command.

You can also copy each command by clicking on the “Copy” button on the right.

The colors on the cheatsheet page automatically adapt to the selected theme. The font is based on the user’s preferred font family.
